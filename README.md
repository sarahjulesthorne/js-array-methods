# JavaScript Array Methods  
### Description  
The project was an exercise in using JavaScript array methods.  
We used unshift and push to insert objects at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.  
We used shift and pop to remove objects from the beginning and end of the array, respectively.  
We used splice to insert objects in the middle of the array.  
We used tools such as conditionals to select where in the array (which array method), to use.  
We used forEach and for loops to iterate over the formed arrays and a string-builder and print function to print HTML cards to the DOM.  
Note: The splice exercise was done as a challenge assignment without instructors' help. See functions `addInMiddle` and `addPassenger`.  
### Screenshots
